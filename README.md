## ✨ Features

- 🎵 Music Library Management
  - Simple directory-based music browsing
  - Supports multiple audio formats via Symphonia
  - Reads music from a configured directory path
    > **Note**: Currently, playlist management is not implemented. The player reads music files directly from a specified directory that you set in the config file or pass as an argument.
- 🌈 Real-time Audio Visualization
  - Dynamic spectrum analyzer with multiple visualization modes
  - Smooth animations and color transitions
  - Responsive to audio frequencies
  - Multithreaded FFT calculation for improved performance
- 🎚️ Audio Controls
  - Volume control
  - Track navigation
  - Real-time audio processing
  - Seek controls (with limitations for FLAC files)
- ⏯️ Playback Controls
  - Play/Pause/Stop functionality
  - Track progress bar
  - Current track information display
  - Duration and time elapsed indicators

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.75.0 or later)
- System audio dependencies:
  - Linux: ALSA development files
  - macOS: No additional dependencies
  - Windows: No additional dependencies

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-d-nabeel/melovitui.git
cd melovitui
```

2. Build and run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Configuration

Before running the application, you need to specify your music directory. You can do this in two ways:

1. Pass the directory as a command-line argument:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --music-dir "/path/to/your/music"
```

2. Or set it in the config file (config.toml):

```toml
music_dir = "/path/to/your/music"
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Keyboard Controls

- **Navigation**
  - `j`: Move down in music library
  - `k`: Move up in music library
  - `Enter`: Play selected track
- **Playback**
  - `p`: Toggle Play/Pause
  - `s`: Stop
  - `h`: Seek backward
  - `l`: Seek forward
- **Volume Control**
  - `←`/`→`: Adjust volume
  - `Shift + ←/→`: Adjust pitch
- **Application**
  - `q`: Quit
  - `?`: Toggle help overlay

> **Note**: Advanced audio processing features (bass and treble adjustment) are currently in development. These features require additional implementation using the DASP (Digital Audio Signal Processing) library. While the key bindings exist in the code (`Shift + ↑/↓` for treble, and `↑/↓` for bass), they are not currently functional.

> **Known Issue**: Seeking in FLAC files is not fully supported due to limitations in the underlying Claxon decoder used by Rodio.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

MeloviTUI is built with a modular architecture:

```

├── app.rs            # Core application state
├── audio_system.rs   # Audio processing and playback
├── controls/         # Input handling and state management
│   ├── audio_engine.rs   # Audio playback engine
│   ├── keybindings.rs    # Keyboard input handling
│   ├── music_library.rs  # Music collection management
│   ├── playback_state.rs # Playback status tracking
│   ├── sound_control.rs  # Volume and audio effects
│   └── spectrum.rs       # FFT processing for visualization
├── logger.rs         # Logging system
└── ui/               # User interface components
    └── components/   # Reusable UI elements
```

### Core Dependencies

- `ratatui`: Terminal user interface framework
- `rodio`: Audio playback
- `symphonia`: Audio decoding
- `rustfft`: Fast Fourier Transform for spectrum analysis
- `log4rs`: Logging system

### Performance Optimizations

- Multithreaded FFT calculation for audio visualization
- Asynchronous spectrum file processing

## 📝 Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory:

- `app.log`: Current session log
- `app.{0-2}.log`: Rotated log files

## 📦 Release Process

### For Developers

To create a new release:

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
version = "x.y.z"  # Update this version number
```

2. Create and push a new tag:

```bash
# Create a new tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Push the tag
git push origin v1.0.0
```

3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Create a new GitHub Release
   - Build binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Generate SHA-256 checksums
   - Attach all files to the release
